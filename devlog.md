I will create a prefix-notation expression calculator in Racket. 
I will be using Racket because it is the functional programming language we have been using so far, and it is the one I am the most familiar with.
My overall plan is to first build the evaluation loop and expression parser. 
Then I will focus on the security of the logic.
